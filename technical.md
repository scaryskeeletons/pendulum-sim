A double pendulum consists of one pendulum suspended from a fixed pivot, with a second pendulum attached to the end of the first. Despite its simple construction, it exhibits chaotic behavior. Two nearly identical starting conditions will diverge into completely different trajectories within seconds. This sensitivity to initial conditions is what makes the system chaotic, and my simulation demonstrates this phenomenon in real time.

I derived the equations of motion using Lagrangian mechanics. The Lagrangian is defined as kinetic energy minus potential energy, and applying the Euler Lagrange equation to it produces the differential equations that govern the system. I represent the state using two angles measured from vertical, one for each pendulum. The kinetic energy term is more involved than a single pendulum because the velocity of the second mass depends on the motion of both links. The resulting differential equations are coupled and nonlinear, which means they have no closed form solution.

The angular acceleration of each pendulum depends on both angles, both angular velocities, both lengths, both masses, and gravity. The coupling between these variables through trigonometric functions is what produces chaotic dynamics. Small numerical differences compound over time because of this nonlinearity.

Without an analytical solution I rely on numerical integration to advance the simulation through time. I implemented the fourth order Runge Kutta method, which estimates the state at the next timestep by evaluating derivatives at four points and computing a weighted average. The physics runs at 480 Hz while the display updates at the monitor's refresh rate. This high integration rate maintains numerical stability and keeps energy conservation errors minimal.

The simulation uses standard simplifying assumptions: massless rigid rods, point masses concentrated at the ends, motion constrained to a plane, a frictionless pivot, no air resistance, and uniform gravity. Optional damping can be enabled to model energy dissipation, but it defaults to off so energy conservation can be observed.
